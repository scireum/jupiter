//! Provides a tiny DI like container to expose all components of the system.
//!
//! The platform is more or less a simple map which keeps all central components as
//! **Arc<T>** around. Also this keeps the central **is_running** flag which is toggled to
//! *false* once [Platform::terminate](Platform::terminate) is invoked.
//!
//! Not that in common cases [Platform::require](Platform::require) is a good way of fetching a
//! service which is known to be there. However, be aware, that once the system shutdown is
//! initiated, the internal map is cleared and empty (so that all Dropped handlers run). Therefore
//! if the code might be executed after [Platform::terminate](Platform::terminate) was called, you
//! should use [Platform::find](Platform::find) and gracefully handle the **None** case. However,
//! in most cases the lookup of services is performed during startup and therefore **require** can
//! be used.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # use apollo_framework::platform::Platform;
//! struct Service {
//!     value : i32
//! }
//!
//! struct UnknownService;
//!
//! let platform = Platform::new();
//!     
//! // Registers a new service...
//! platform.register::<Service>(Arc::new(Service { value: 42 }));
//!     
//! // Obtains a reference to a previously registered service...
//! let service = platform.require::<Service>();
//! assert_eq!(service.value, 42);
//!
//! // Trying to obtain a service which hasn't been registered yet, returns an empty
//! // optional...
//! assert_eq!(platform.find::<UnknownService>().is_none(), true);
//!
//! // By default the platform is running...
//! assert_eq!(platform.is_running(), true);
//!     
//! // Once terminated...
//! platform.terminate();
//! // All services are immediately released so that their "Dropped" handlers run...
//! assert_eq!(platform.find::<Service>().is_none(), true);
//!
//! // and the platform is no longer considered active...
//! assert_eq!(platform.is_running(), false);
//! ```
