//! Provides the dispatcher which delegates an incoming request to the matching implementation.
//!
//! At its core, a [CommandsCommandDictionary](CommandDictionary) dictionary is simply a hash map.
//! For each known command, it contains an appropriate entry. This however, doesn't point to a trait
//! impl or the like, rather it points to a [Queue](Queue) and keeps a numeric index along. If the
//! matching command is received, the request, a pre-initialized response and the numeric index are
//! all wrapped in a [Call](Call). This call is also equipped with the **Sender** of a oneshot
//! channel through which the final response will be send. This call is then sent to the actor which
//! is responsible for handling the command using the queue in the dictionary. Once the actor
//! completed handling the request, the response is sent back (most probably with the help of
//! [ResultExt](ResultExt)) and the response will be then returned.
//!
//! This approach seems complex at first sight but provides many advantages. First of all, using
//! queues from and to the actor permits us to write 100% async/await code without having to
//! hack around async traits (which aren't directly supported in Rust right now and would require
//! an allocation anyway). Furthermore using a single queue for all commands of an actor (hence the
//! token which can be specified per command) makes the actor internally behave like a single
//! threaded task which greatly simplifies concurrency and synchronization requirements.
//!
//! Note that actually the **Commands** is only a container to collect and keep all known commands.
//! Each client will request a [Dispatcher](Dispatcher) from it, which can then dispatch incoming
//! requests and return the appropriate results. This is used so that no locking or other
//! synchronization primitives are required during operation (once the server is setup, the commands
//! dictionary will never change anyway).
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! When handling a command, a function which returns a [CommandResult](CommandResult) should be
//! used. This way, one can simply call `my_handler(&mut call).complete(call)` which will return
//! either the response or the error into the callback within **call**. Note that two macros
//! [server_error](server_error) and [client_error](client_error) are provided. The former should
//! be used if a server-sided problem occurs, the latter if the client sent inconsistent or
//! incompatible data. Note also that any **anyhow::Error** can be transformed into a CommandError,
//! which will then be treat just like a **client_error**.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Registering a command:
//! ```no_run
//! # use jupiter::commands::{CommandDictionary, queue, CommandError};
//!
//! // Create a new command queue to listen to....
//! let (queue, mut endpoint) = queue();
//!
//! // Bind a simple actor which only responds to a single command to the endpoint
//! // of the queue.
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     loop {
//!         match endpoint.recv().await {
//!             // Because of the simple implementation, we directly respond with "PONG" and perform
//!             // the error handling / completion manually...
//!             Some(mut call) => match call.response.simple("PONG") {
//!                 Ok(_) => call.complete(Ok(())),
//!                 Err(error) => call.complete(Err(CommandError::OutputError(error))),
//!              },
//!              _ => return,
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Register the queue for the "PING" command. We can pass "0" here as token, as the actor
//! // doesn't check it anyway as only a single command is handled via this queue...
//! let commands = CommandDictionary::new();
//! commands.register_command("PING", queue, 0);
//! ```
//!
//! When handling several commands via a single queue, using **num_traits** and **num_derive** is
//! recommended. This way one can define all commands as an enum as done in the following example:
//!
//! ```
//! # use bytes::BytesMut;
//! # use num_derive::FromPrimitive;
//! # use num_traits::FromPrimitive;
//! # use jupiter::commands::{queue, Call, CommandDictionary, CommandError, CommandResult, ResultExt};
//! # use jupiter::request::Request;
//!
//! // A simple command with responds PONG for every PING...
//! fn ping(task: &mut Call) -> CommandResult {
//!     task.response.simple("PONG")?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! // Another simple command which simply replies with "OK"...
//! fn test(task: &mut Call) -> CommandResult {
//!     task.response.simple("OK")?;
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! /// Defines an enum to list all supported commands...
//! #[derive(num_derive::FromPrimitive)]
//! enum TestCommands {
//!     Ping,
//!     Test,
//! }
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!
//!     // Defines an actor which delegates incoming calls to the proper function as defined
//!     // above...
//!     let (queue, mut endpoint) = queue();
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         loop {
//!             match endpoint.recv().await {
//!                 Some(mut call) => match TestCommands::from_usize(call.token) {
//!                     Some(TestCommands::Ping) => ping(&mut call).complete(call),
//!                     Some(TestCommands::Test) => test(&mut call).complete(call),
//!                     _ => call.handle_unknown_token(),
//!                 },
//!                 _ => return,
//!             }
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     // Build a dictionary, register both commands and obtain a dispatcher from it...
//!     let commands = CommandDictionary::new();
//!     commands.register_command("PING", queue.clone(), TestCommands::Ping as usize);
//!     commands.register_command("TEST", queue.clone(), TestCommands::Test as usize);
//!     let mut dispatcher = commands.dispatcher();
//!
//!     // Send a "PING" as RESP request and expect a "PONG" as RESP response...
//!     let request = Request::example(vec!("PING"));
//!     let result = dispatcher.invoke(request, None).await.unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(std::str::from_utf8(&result[..]).unwrap(), "+PONG\r\n");
//!
//!     // Send a "TEST" as RESP request and expect a "OK" as RESP response...
//!     let request = Request::example(vec!("TEST"));
//!     let result = dispatcher.invoke(request, None).await.unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(std::str::from_utf8(&result[..]).unwrap(), "+OK\r\n");
//! }
//! ```
